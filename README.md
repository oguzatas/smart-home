# Smarthome Simulation With Arduino

## Smart Home
### I. Introduction
a. Problem
 In traditional home setups, controlling devices such as lights, door locks, and alarm systems requires manual interaction. There is limited automation, no centralized control, and a lack of responsiveness to environmental conditions such as temperature or motion. These limitations result in inefficiency, inconvenience, and potential security vulnerabilities.
b. Solution
 To address these issues, we designed a smart home simulation system using Arduino Mega that integrates essential home automation components: lighting control, door locking via servo motor, RGB-based temperature indication using a potentiometer, and a motion-based security alert system using an ultrasonic sensor. The system provides automated, responsive, and efficient control for a secure and adaptable living environment.
II. Design
 The design includes:
Room Lighting: 4 LEDs connected to pins 22, 24, 26, and 28, each paired with a switch on pins 23, 25, 27, and 29 respectively.


Temperature Simulation: A potentiometer connected to A0 simulates temperature input, controlling an RGB LED on pins 9 (R), 10 (G), and 11 (B).


Security System: An HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor on pins 6 (Trig) and 7 (Echo) detects motion. A warning LED is activated on pin 8.


Door Locking Mechanism: A servo motor on pin 12 simulates a door lock, controlled by a push button on pin 5.
 Each component is wired with appropriate resistors (220 ohm for LEDs), and the system is powered via Arduino Mega to accommodate the required I/O capacity.




### III. Achievements
a. Hardware
Successfully integrated all components on SimulIDE.


Correctly assigned digital and analog pins to prevent conflicts.


Ensured each LED, sensor, and motor behaves as intended in response to user input or environmental change.


b. Firmware
Developed Arduino code to:


Toggle room lights using corresponding switches.


Dynamically change RGB color based on potentiometer values.


Detect movement and activate security LED.


Operate servo motor to simulate lock/unlock actions on button press.


Code compiled and uploaded using Arduino CLI, allowing headless deployment.


### IV. Challenges and Possible Solutions
Limited I/O Pins: Initially limited by Uno's I/O count; resolved by switching to Arduino Mega.


Component Behavior Conflicts: Servo and sensors needed specific timing; solved using non-blocking code structure.


Simulation Limitations: Some modules not available in SimulIDE (e.g., buzzer with sound output); substituted with LEDs for alert representation.




### V. Future Timeline
Implement sensor-driven decision-making (e.g., lock door when no motion detected for X mins).


Add Bluetooth module to simulate mobile control.


Optimize power consumption (e.g., sleep modes for idle components).


Transition to a real-world hardware setup and prepare final demo.


This structured progression ensures that the system evolves from a functional simulation into a practical smart home prototype.
